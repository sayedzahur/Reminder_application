# Reminder_application
This project titled 'Reminder application' is aimed towards making daily life of people easier.
This simple application was developed on eclipse IDE platform as a console application.

Using this application, user can easily get a reminder of his day to day life tasks.
There is even provision to categorize different tasks.
Each task can be loaded into its respective categories with time and date as to when the task is to be reminded.
It was observed that the task was successfully able to notify the user at the mentioned time.
After the alarm notification, the task is successfully saved unless there is any sort of error. 
One major improvement that can be done in this project is that we can provide an option to delete tasks, which is not yet available now.

This project includes the below mentioned topics:
*Abstraction of classes, Scope and Lifetime of variables, Declaring objects.
*Instance Variables of different data types, Constructors/Methods, 'this' keyword.
*Inheritance, Overriding, Objects as parameters.
*Access control mechanism.
*Packages, Interfaces, Exception Handling.
*Thread pool, String handling mechanism using String Buffer class.
*Some array and list concepts.

This project was done as a part of my college internal assessment assignment.
I would like to extend my gratitude towards my college mentor Mr.Suhaas.K.P who had taught the object oriented concepts to the best extent possible.

Thank you,
